# Test Data

This directory holds shared test fixtures for the test suite.

## Sample fixtures

- `LIVE/LIVE-keybindings.json`: Reduced sample of Star Citizen keybindings (~30 representative actions) for integration coverage.
- `actionmaps_sample.xml`: Minimal CryXML action map sample for parser tests.
- `localization_sample.xml`: Minimal localization XML sample for parser tests.

## Notes

- The LIVE-keybindings.json file is a reduced sample containing representative keybindings for testing the keybinding loading pipeline.
- This sample file includes all activation mode metadata and diverse binding examples (keyboard, mouse, joystick, gamepad).
