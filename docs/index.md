Welcome to the Star Citizen Stream Deck Plugin!
This plugin allows you to control various aspects of Star Citizen directly from your Elgato Stream Deck.

## Quick Start

1. Click the `Download Latest` button above.
2. Double-click the downloaded `.streamDeckPlugin` file.
3. Open Stream Deck and drag the desired key from the right panel onto a key slot on the left.

!!! tip "The Plugin needs some time to initialize."
    - Wait until the loading spinner on the keys disappears.  
    - If it could not detect your Star Citizen installation, it will show an error message.  
    - In this case, open the `Control Panel` key and set a custom installation path for your desired channel (`LIVE`, `HOTFIX`, `PTU`, `EPTU`).

    - *Example:* 2 in game bindings (Tap vs Hold) on `Num-` executes only the Tap function when this is the assigned function.

- **Auto-Detection of Star Citizen Installation Path**: Automatically detects the installation path of Star Citizen.
- **Multiple Channels Support**: Supports different Star Citizen channels including LIVE, HOTFIX, PTU, and EPTU.
- **Mouse Wheel Support**: Supports mouse wheel actions for bindings that utilize mouse wheel input (Mouse Wheel Up/Down).
- **Custom Language Support**: Supports custom language files for localization when using custom global.ini from the Community, e.g. [StarCitizen-Deutsch-INI by rjcncpt](https://github.com/rjcncpt/StarCitizen-Deutsch-INI).
- **Theme Support**: Themes for customizing the appearance of the plugin. Includes a template for creating your own themes!
